 -- LESSONS LEARNED --
 1. Disable cors in SecurityFilterChain on backend and add @CrossOrigin to all controllers 
 2. Do not put Buttons inside the <form> tag, otherwise browser blocks the outgoing request
 3. Import useStore from Store.js not from Zustand for the second time
 4. Use useEffect() instead of relying on synchronicity of operations
